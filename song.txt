All I am,
Is a man,
I want the world,
In my hands.
I hate the beach,
But I stand,
In California with my toes in the sand.

Use the sleeves of my sweater,
Let’s have an adventure.
Head in the clouds,
But my gravity’s centered.
Touch my neck,
And I’ll touch yours,
You in those little high waisted shorts.

She knows what I think about,
And What I think about,
One love. Two mouths.
One love. One house.
No Shirt. No Blouse.
Just us. You find out.
Nothing that we don’t want to tell you about, No.
